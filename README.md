# mpu6050STM32
mpu6050 demo program for an STM32F103C board. You should be able to use the same code with other Arduino board. It uses a bluetooth module to send the data to an Android device. The bluetooth module needs to be connected to serial port 1 of the STM32 board.
I have made 2 versions. One is using the interrupt pin and the other one isn't.
To display the rocket on your Android phone use my other app.
